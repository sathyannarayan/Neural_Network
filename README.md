#A introduction to Neural Network using Scikit learn library

The Multi layer perceptron model uses Quasi-Newton method called LBFS(Limited memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm) which used for 
parameter estimation in ML and will apply for optimization problems with large number of inputs. Alpha is the learning constant set to (0.0001).
hidden_layer_sizes=(5, 4) specify that there 4 hidden layers with 5 units each. The fit method matches data model with X matrix and targets y.
Predict Method is then used to input matrix X and output y(predicted class). Predict_Proba() gives the predicted probabbility of the sample of each class.
